# AHK_Module
A place where I post scripts modules that you can copy-paste into your script

please be noticed  I will post some `bat` and `exe`   since they are better to handle windows in a native way  

## Installation

for `Ahk` just copy-paste it and then modify it

for `EXE` and `Bat` just make it runnable with `Run` command


```bash
Run, C:\xxxxx\Hello_world.bat
```

## .AHK 
[`suspend.v1.ahk`](/suspend.v1.ahk) press a Butten to turn off, on `AHK` hotkeys


## .Bat

[ `kill_ahk64u.bat`](/kill_ahk64u.bat)   kill All `AHK` process
